WPC Variation Swatches is a beautiful color, image, radio and buttons variation swatches for WooCommerce product attributes

== Description ==

**WPC Variation Swatches for WooCommerce** will definitely kill the game for online shops and WooCommerce sites with an elegant, responsive look and impressive effects. There’s no better way to showcase your products in the best look and assist customers in choosing their preferred options. WPC Variation Swatches offers a variety of predefined styles for attributes of variable products, with the ability to use different selector types on a single product page and position tooltips at the best position for a great match with your theme/template.

More remarkably, **WPC Variation Swatches** is fully compatible with other WPC plugins, which offers the chance to use swatches on a [Smart Bundle](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-product-bundle/), [Frequently Bought Together](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-bought-together/), [Force Sells](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-force-sells/) or [Smart Grouped Product](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-grouped-product/) without the need to worry about the compatibility and experience.

= Various Selector Types On A Page =

A notable highlight in the feature list of the WPC Variation Swatches plugin is the possibility to use up to 5 different types for attributes on a single product page.

From the admin dashboard, navigate to the Products section >> Attributes >> in the Type option of each attribute, click on the list you can find 5 different types:

- Select (dropdown, default)
- Radio
- Buttons
- Image
- Color

For variable products that have 5 attributes as in our [live demo](https://demo.wpclever.net/wpcvs/), you can choose a suitable type for each attribute based on your preferences. This is truly useful for optimizing the appearance and arranging your product page for optimal user experience.

= Buttons As Default Type For Custom Attributes =

From the plugin settings, choose “Yes” for the “Button swatches by default” option to set button swatches as the default type for all custom attributes. This will save time when users need to configure the swatches type in bulk.

Note: Except for 2 default attributes by WooCommerce (size & color), all other custom attributes with a different name from these are supposed to have the default dropdown (Select) type. Turn this option on will replace the dropdown with button swatches for all custom attributes on your store automatically.
