## Pro Features

### Domestic Shipping
All the domestic shipping options are supported: Regular Post, Express Post and Courier Post. You can anytime, disable/enable one or all of these options.

### Default Size and Weight
In case you don’t want to add weight and dimensions for all of the products you have or even you missed adding this information to one of them. The plugin allows you to set a default weight and dimensions of your product in case of the product’s information are missing.

### Debug Mode
The debug mode is an excellent tool to test out the plugin’s settings and shipping prices as the plugin will be only activated for you. Also, it will display debugging information at the checkout page if the Debug Mode is enabled.

### Delivery Time
Give your Cart/Checkout pages a professional aspect by displaying an estimation of the delivery time.
### International Shipping
A wide range of international shipping options are supported:

* Economy Air
* Economy Sea
* Standard International
* Express International
* Courier International

### Custom Boxes
I bet you that you want to give your customers the most accurate shipping price. That’s why we have the feature of Custom Boxes, where you can add all of your shipping boxes information. Then the plugin will use this information to calculate the most accurate shipping price.
### Custom Titles
We are eager to grant our customers the maximum options for customizations, other than adding your own shipping boxes, you can even rename every shipping option title to be displayed on the Cart/Checkout pages.
### Shipping Tracking
Give your customers a peace of mind by providing the Australia Post tracking number on the order page. Then a shipping tracking link will be created at their account and also will be included in the order emails.

### Handling Fees and Discounts
If either you need to add a handling fees for your shipping order, or if you want to reduce the shipping costs for your customers. We set an option for that where you can add an amount value to reduce or increase the shipping cost. The value can be either a number or a percentage, positive for handling fees and negative for discounts.

### Extra Cover
Here is another feature to give you or your customers a peace of mind. You can enable the Extra Cover option in case your item's lost or damaged in transition, you should be qualified for compensation.

### Signature on Delivery
You want to make sure that your package was delivered to the right person? No problem. Just enable the Signature on Delivery option.

### Separate Extra Services
Awesome. Another customizing option. Sometimes you want your customers to have the option whether they want Extra Cover or Signature on Delivery with their order. You only need to enable this option. But keep in mind to also enable Extra Cover or Signature on Delivery.

### Display the Cheapest options
Cut to the Chase and provide the cheapest option to your customers without putting them in the hustle of choosing from many options.
